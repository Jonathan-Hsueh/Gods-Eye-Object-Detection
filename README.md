### Gods-Eye-Object-Detection

**Description:**
Gods-Eye-Object-Detection is an advanced web-based application designed for real-time handgun detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. This project aims to enhance security and surveillance by providing a robust and efficient detection system that can identify handguns in various environments.

**Process:**
- **Data Preparation:** Collected and preprocessed a comprehensive dataset containing images of handguns and other objects.
- **Model Training:** Utilized the pre-trained YOLO model, fine-tuning it with the specific dataset to improve accuracy and robustness.
- **Integration:** Seamlessly integrated the trained YOLO model into the web application for real-time detection capabilities.
- **Testing and Deployment:** Conducted extensive testing in real-world scenarios to ensure reliability and accuracy, followed by deployment on a web server for public access.

**Key Features:**
- **YOLO Model Integration:** Leveraged the YOLO model for its speed and accuracy in object detection, enabling real-time identification of handguns.
- **RTMP Streaming Support:** Planned support for RTMP (Real-Time Messaging Protocol) streaming to broadcast live detection results to various platforms.
- **OpenCV Live Sharing:** Utilized OpenCV to process and share live video feeds, applying the detection model to each frame in real-time.

**Skills Utilized:**
1. **Python Programming:** Developed the detection pipeline and integrated various components using Python.
2. **Computer Vision:** Applied computer vision concepts and libraries such as OpenCV for real-time video processing.
3. **Deep Learning:** Implemented deep learning frameworks, particularly the YOLO model, for object detection.
4. **Web Development:** Created and deployed the user interface for the detection system.
5. **RTMP Streaming:** Worked with RTMP protocol and streaming technologies for live broadcasting.
6. **Data Preprocessing and Annotation:** Collected, cleaned, and annotated images for training machine learning models.
